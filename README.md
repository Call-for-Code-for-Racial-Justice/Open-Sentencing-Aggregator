# Create and deploy a Java - MicroProfile / Java EE application

To build the application you can run
```bash
docker build . -t <your-tag>
```

If you want to deploy the application to an OpenShift Cluster (ROKS) on IBM Cloud, perform the following steps:
```bash
ibmcloud login
ibmcloud cr login # logs you in to the Docker registry with your local Docker CLI
docker push <your-tag>
# Make sure your Container Registry is accessible by the ServiceAccount you are using, the default namespace and default ServiceAccount in an ROKS cluster are already integrated by default with the IBM Container Registry in your cloud account
helm package chart/base/
helm install --set image.repository=us.icr.io/emb-race-team/os-aggregator --set image.tag=helm-01 --set db.iamkey=<your-iam-key> --set db.url=https://<your-db-instance> aggregator os-aggregator-1.1.4.tgz --namespace deploy-test
```

If you want to install to a different namespace, you have to copy the secret first as described here (or create a new one): https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-registry#copy_imagePullSecret

## Steps

You can [deploy this application to IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/appservice/starter-kits/java-liberty-app) or [build it locally](#building-locally) by cloning this repo first.  Once your app is live, you can access the `/health` endpoint to build out your cloud native application.

### Deploying to IBM Cloud

</p>

Click **Deploy to IBM Cloud** to deploy this same application to IBM Cloud. This option creates a deployment pipeline, complete with a hosted GitLab project and a DevOps toolchain. You can deploy your app to Cloud Foundry, a Kubernetes cluster, or a Red Hat OpenShift cluster. OpenShift is available only through a standard cluster, which requires you to have a billable account.

[IBM Cloud DevOps](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/devops) services provides toolchains as a set of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks inside IBM Cloud.

### Building Locally

To get started building this application locally, you can either run the application natively or use the [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) for containerization and easy deployment to IBM Cloud.

#### Native Application Development

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* Java 8: Any compliant JVM should work.
  * [Java 8 JDK from Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
  * [Java 8 JDK from IBM (AIX, Linux, z/OS, IBM i)](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/),
    or [Download a Liberty server package](https://developer.ibm.com/assets/wasdev/#filter/assetTypeFilters=PRODUCT)
    that contains the IBM JDK (Windows, Linux)

To build and run the application:
1. `mvn install`
1. `mvn liberty:run-server`

To run an application in Docker use the Docker file called `Dockerfile`. If you do not want to install Maven locally you can use `Dockerfile-tools` to build a container with Maven installed.

You can verify the state of your locally running application using the Selenium UI test script included in the `scripts` directory.

#### IBM Cloud Developer Tools

Install [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) on your machine by running the following command:
```
curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
```

Create an application on IBM Cloud by running:

```bash
ibmcloud dev create
```

This will create and download a starter application with the necessary files needed for local development and deployment.

Your application will be compiled with Docker containers. To compile and run your app, run:

```bash
ibmcloud dev build
ibmcloud dev run
```

This will launch your application locally. When you are ready to deploy to IBM Cloud on Cloud Foundry or Kubernetes, run one of the following commands:

```bash
ibmcloud dev deploy -t buildpack // to Cloud Foundry
ibmcloud dev deploy -t container // to K8s cluster
```

You can build and debug your app locally with:

```bash
ibmcloud dev build --debug
ibmcloud dev debug
```
